                question: "Which of the following best describes the role of capillary hydrostatic pressure in Starling forces?",
                options: [
                    "A. Draws fluid inward from interstitium",
                    "B. Forces fluid outward from capillaries to interstitium",
                    "C. Forces fluid from interstitium to capillaries",
                    "D. Draws fluid outward to interstitium"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pc) forces fluid outward from capillaries to interstitium. This is one of the four primary Starling forces that govern fluid balance across capillary membranes."
            },
            {
                question: "Which condition is characterized by a passive process with impaired blood outflow from tissue?",
                options: [
                    "A. Active hyperemia",
                    "B. Congestion",
                    "C. Hemorrhage",
                    "D. Thrombosis"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Congestion is a passive process with impaired blood outflow from tissue, resulting in accumulation of deoxygenated blood. This contrasts with active hyperemia, which involves increased blood inflow due to arteriolar dilation."
            },
            {
                question: "A patient presents with minute 1-2 mm hemorrhages in the skin. This is best described as:",
                options: [
                    "A. Petechiae",
                    "B. Purpura",
                    "C. Ecchymosis",
                    "D. Hematoma"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "Petechiae are minute 1-2 mm hemorrhages in skin, mucosa, or serosal surfaces. Purpura are slightly larger (3mm), ecchymosis are larger than 1-2cm subcutaneous hematomas, and hematoma refers to hemorrhage enclosed within tissue or cavity."
            },
            {
                question: "Which component of Virchow's triad is considered the most important factor in arterial thrombosis?",
                options: [
                    "A. Turbulence or stasis",
                    "B. Hypercoagulability",
                    "C. Endothelial injury",
                    "D. Platelet aggregation"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Endothelial injury is the most important factor in Virchow's triad, particularly in heart and arterial circulation. It exposes thrombogenic subendothelial matrix (collagen, tissue factors) that initiate thrombosis."
            },
            {
                question: "A 65-year-old patient develops sudden dyspnea and chest pain. Imaging reveals a saddle embolus in the pulmonary arteries. What is the most likely source?",
                options: [
                    "A. Deep vein thrombosis",
                    "B. Atrial fibrillation",
                    "C. Aortic dissection",
                    "D. Pulmonary hypertension"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "95% of pulmonary thromboembolisms arise from deep leg vein thrombi. These travel to the right heart and then to pulmonary arteries, where a large saddle embolus can cause sudden death by blocking the outflow tract or bifurcation."
            },
            {
                question: "Which type of infarct typically occurs in solid organs with single blood supply?",
                options: [
                    "A. Red (hemorrhagic) infarct",
                    "B. White (anemic) infarct",
                    "C. Septic infarct",
                    "D. Bland infarct"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "White (anemic) infarcts occur with arterial occlusion in organs with single blood supply, such as the heart, spleen, and kidney. Red infarcts occur in venous occlusions, loose tissues, or tissues with dual circulation."
            },
            {
                question: "A patient with extensive burns develops widespread bleeding from multiple sites. Laboratory tests show thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, and reduced fibrinogen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
                options: [
                    "A. Hemophilia",
                    "B. Vitamin K deficiency",
                    "C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)",
                    "D. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "This presentation is classic for DIC, which is characterized by consumption coagulopathy with paradoxical bleeding and thrombosis. In burn patients, autoinfusion of thromboplastin from tissues triggers the coagulation cascade, leading to consumption of clotting factors and platelets."
            },
            {
                question: "Which type of shock is characterized by profound peripheral vasodilation despite normal or high cardiac output?",
                options: [
                    "A. Hypovolemic shock",
                    "B. Cardiogenic shock",
                    "C. Distributive shock",
                    "D. Obstructive shock"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Distributive shock involves profound peripheral vasodilation despite normal or high cardiac output. This includes septic shock (most common), neurogenic shock, anaphylactic shock, and endocrine shock."
            },
            {
                question: "A patient with myocardial infarction develops severe hypotension, pulmonary edema, and requires inotropic support. Which stage of shock is this patient most likely in?",
                options: [
                    "A. Initial nonprogressive phase",
                    "B. Progressive stage",
                    "C. Irreversible stage",
                    "D. Compensated stage"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "This describes the progressive stage of shock, characterized by tissue hypoperfusion with worsening circulatory and metabolic imbalances. Widespread tissue hypoxia leads to anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, and cellular swelling."
